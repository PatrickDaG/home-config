# Welcome to my et cetera config

This repo mostly contains config files that reside in
my home folder and therefore make it difficult to
have their own repos.

To deploy use fora:

```bash
pip install fora
fora -v patrick@localhost deploy.py
```
Deployment script currently untested and most likely broken
